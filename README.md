## Overview
The **Raspberry Pi Server** project is a complete guide to setting up a robust server on a Raspberry Pi. With step-by-step instructions, reusable Docker configurations, and monitoring setups, you'll be able to deploy applications and services quickly and easily on your Raspberry Pi.

### What does it do?
This project enables the setup of a multi-service server environment on Raspberry Pi. The services include:
- **NGINX**: A flexible web server and reverse proxy.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For real-time monitoring and alerting of system metrics.

You can use this server for a variety of tasks, such as web hosting, CI/CD pipelines, automation, or personal monitoring dashboards.

## Features
- **Complete Setup Instructions**: Detailed, beginner-friendly documentation for setting up Ubuntu Server on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily add or modify services like web servers, databases, and monitoring tools.
- **Pre-configured Docker Containers**: Use Docker to isolate and manage applications.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana to visualize and monitor your server's performance.
- **Maintenance Scripts**: Automated scripts to help you with tasks like backup, updates, and service management.

Getting Started

To get started with the Raspberry Pi Server project, follow the steps below:
Prerequisites

    A Raspberry Pi 4 or newer.
    A microSD card with at least 16 GB of storage.
    A network connection (Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
    Ubuntu Server installed on the Raspberry Pi.

Installation Guide

    Flash Ubuntu Server onto your microSD card using tools like Balena Etcher.

    Boot the Raspberry Pi and log in via SSH:
```

ssh ubuntu@<raspberry_pi_ip>
```
```
Default username: ubuntu, password: ubuntu.
```
Update the system:

``` 

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Install Docker:
```
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```
Verify Docker installation:
```
docker --version
```
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RonanJoel/raspberry-pi-server..git
``` 
Build the Docker services:

    docker-compose up -d

For detailed steps, refer to the setup.md guide.
Services Included
NGINX

NGINX is set up as a reverse proxy and web server for hosting your applications. You can configure it to serve static files, handle HTTP requests, or forward traffic to backend services.

Configuration: The nginx.conf file is located in the config/ directory.
Docker

Docker enables you to containerize your applications, making it easier to manage and deploy services on the Raspberry Pi.

Usage: The docker-compose.yml file defines the services running on Docker (e.g., NGINX, databases, etc.).
Prometheus & Grafana

Prometheus collects metrics from your server, while Grafana visualizes these metrics in real-time. This setup helps you monitor your server's health and performance.

Configuration: The Prometheus and Grafana configurations are included in the docker-compose.yml file and the config/ directory.
Usage

Once your Raspberry Pi server is set up and Docker services are running, you can start accessing the following:

    NGINX Web Server: Access your server at http://<raspberry_pi_ip>.
    Grafana Monitoring Dashboard (if configured): Access the dashboard at http://<raspberry_pi_ip>:3000.

To stop all services:

docker-compose down

For more detailed usage instructions, check out usage.md.
