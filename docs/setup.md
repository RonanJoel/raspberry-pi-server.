# Raspberry Pi Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi 4 or later.
- A microSD card with at least 16 GB of storage.
- Ethernet or Wi-Fi for network connectivity.

## Installation Steps
1. Download and flash Ubuntu Server onto your microSD card using tools like Balena Etcher.
2. Boot the Raspberry Pi and connect via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@<raspberry_pi_ip>

The default username is ubuntu, and the password is also ubuntu.

    Update the system:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install Docker:

sudo apt install -y docker.io

Verify the installation:

    docker --version

Post-installation Setup

Once Docker is installed, you can proceed with setting up additional services as outlined in docs/usage.md.

Components

    Docker: For containerized applications.
    NGINX: As a reverse proxy or web server.
    Prometheus/Grafana: For monitoring (optional).

Service Descriptions

    NGINX: Acts as a web server and reverse proxy to handle traffic to containerized applications.
    Docker: Runs applications in isolated containers for efficiency.

# Usage Guide

## Starting Services
To start all configured services, run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d

Accessing the Server

    NGINX: http://<raspberry_pi_ip>
    Monitoring Dashboard (if configured): http://<raspberry_pi_ip>:3000

Maintenance

To stop all services:

docker-compose down

Updating Services

To update containerized services:

docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d


#### **`config/docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx_server
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    volumes:
      - ./config/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    restart: always

  # You can add other services like databases, monitoring tools, etc.

networks:
